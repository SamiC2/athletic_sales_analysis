# athletic_sales_analysis
## By Sami Chowdhury
### Columbia AI Bootcamp Week 5 HW

This was a simple assignment involving reading in csv files to dataframes, combining them using inner joins, and then performing groupbys and pivot tables on the data to categorize it based on the requirements. Resampling was also done to categorize the data using datetime. The goal was to find the most sold / most sales across different categories, such as by retailer or region, or by timeframes, such as weekly or daily. The weekly assignments made this easy to complete. Any feedback is appreciated as always.
